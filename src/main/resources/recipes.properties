Pickled-Peppers=\n\n----------------------------\nIngredients\n-----------------------------\n- 1 Clove Garlic\n- 200cc Wine Vinegar\n- 200cc Water\nYa know, I go loose with the Water and Vinegar, this last time I actually measured how much water\nit would take to FILL all my containers, which was like 3 random jars I had that had good caps.\nThen did about 60% of that amount in Vinegar and %40 in water (I like a little kick) but my Wife's way has 50% 50%\n- 3 Tablespoons Sugar\n- 2 Teaspoons Salt\n- 1 Bay Leaf\n- A pinch of Coriander\n- 6 Hot Peppers (again, go loose here, I mix n match and can even add the other things like carrots etc.)\n------------------------------\n\n------------------------------\nCut the Garlic into small pieces\nMix the water, vinegar, salt, sugar, bay leaf, and corieander in a pot, put on the cover, and heat till it boils. Once it starts to boil, remove the pot from stove and let it cool completely (you can put in the refrigerator actually).\n\nWhile waiting for it to cool, sterilize your containers and lids in boiling hot watter, as well as any tools you will use to handle the jars, or to stir etc. \n\nOnce boiled a while, take the jars out and let them cool.\n\nNext, cut the peppers into whatever shape you like your peppers in\n\nOnce the Jars are cool again, put peppers (and any other items you will pickle with them) into the jars\n\nPour the cool Vinegar mix (do not want to cook the peppers) into the jars. The vinegar should completely cover the peppers in the jars.\n\nSeal the Jars and put em in the fridge for at least a few days but 1 - 2 weeks is best (they will keep in there a long time actually). \n\nFinally enjoy them with everything.\n\n
